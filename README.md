## Summary

Hello my name is Indra Kiiver I am a 19 year old Engineering student studying at JCU
here are my 3 things I have learned about clean code in this subject:

- clean code should good commit messages so that you know what has been updated
- clean code should be separated by empty lines to be able to be read, (ctrl alt l) automatically refactors the code
- lastly clean code should have good function names

here you can access the practicalls and their information aswell as programing patterns:
